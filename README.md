# Workload-Prediction-of-Alibaba-Cluster-Dataset
Through this project we have comprehensively evaluated 10 workload predictors and identified which predictor works the best for Alibaba Cluster dataset to predict the future workload. 
The 10 workload predictors are: Naive predictor, Mean based predictor, Moving Average, Weighted Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, Linear regression model, AR model, ARMA model, ARIMA model, LSTM model. Besides this the sliding window approch has been applied to AR, ARMA, ARIMA and LSTM models. 
After implementation, these predictors have been evaluated through RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MASE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) evaluation metrics in order to compare the performance of these models and to identify the best model for workload prediction of Alibaba cluster dataset.
